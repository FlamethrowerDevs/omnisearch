# Omnisearch
> Find files anywhere on the Interwebz with ease!

## What?
It's a search engine for files. Enter your query, click a result, and wait for it to download. It's that simple!

## Why?
I was too lazy to search individual sites manually.

## How?

### Windows
- `python3 -m venv env`
- `env\Scripts\activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `start.bat`

## Linux
- `bash setup.sh`
- (on later runs) `bash start.sh`

A server should be running on `:8000`. Play around with the UI, enable and disable modules, and click search. That's it.

## Why should I care?
Do you like free files? Yes? Great! This can help you find those free files.

## If I do care, how can I help?
Glad you asked! See the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
